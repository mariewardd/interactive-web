        AFTER SO MANY HITS TO THE HEAD THAT I'VE LOST COUNT,
        CERTAIN TASKS TEND TO LEAD TO A NUMBER OF SYMPTOMS; <br><br>
        MESSED UP VISION, PULSING HEADACHES, OR THE FEELING
        THAT MY BRAIN IS TOO BIG FOR MY SKULL. <br> <br>
        THESE PAGES WERE A SORT OF WAY THAT COULD SIMULATE
        WHAT MY HEAD OFTEN FEELS LIKE IF YOU CATCH ME ON A 
        BAD HEAD DAY.
